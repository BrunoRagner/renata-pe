## The node.js example app

[![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/contentful/the-example-app.nodejs.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/contentful/the-example-app.nodejs)

The node.js example app teaches the very basics of how to work with Contentful:

- consume content from the Contentful Delivery and Preview APIs
- model content
- edit content through the Contentful web app

The app demonstrates how decoupling content from its presentation enables greater flexibility and facilitates shipping higher quality software more quickly.

## What is Contentful?

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.

## Requirements

* Node 8
* Git
* Contentful CLI (only for write access)

Without any changes, this app is connected to a Contentful space with read-only access. To experience the full end-to-end Contentful experience, you need to connect the app to a Contentful space with read _and_ write access. This enables you to see how content editing in the Contentful web app works and how content changes propagate to this app.

## Common setup

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/contentful/the-example-app.nodejs.git
cd the-example-app.nodejs
```

```bash
npm install
```

## Steps for read-only access

To start the express server, run the following

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and take a look around.


## Steps for read and write access (recommended)

Step 1: Install the [Contentful CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/contentful-cli)

Step 2: Login to Contentful through the CLI. It will help you to create a [free account](https://www.contentful.com/sign-up/) if you don't have one already.
```
contentful login
```
Step 3: Create a new space
```
contentful space create --name 'My space for the example app'
```
Step 4: [Seed](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli/tree/master/docs/space/seed) the new space with the example content model [`the-example-app`](https://github.com/contentful/content-models/tree/master/the-example-app). Replace the `SPACE_ID` with the id returned from the create command executed in step 3
```
contentful space seed -s '<SPACE_ID>' -t the-example-app
```
Step 5: Head to the Contentful web app's API section and grab `SPACE_ID`, `DELIVERY_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

Step 6: Open `variables.env` and inject your credentials so it looks like this

```
NODE_ENV=development
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=<SPACE_ID>
CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN=<DELIVERY_ACCESS_TOKEN>
CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_TOKEN=<PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN>
PORT=3000
```

Step 7: To start the express server, run the following
```bash
npm run start:dev
```
Final Step:

Open [http://localhost:3000?editorial_features=enabled](http://localhost:3000?editorial_features=enabled) and take a look around. This URL flag adds an ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù button in the app on every editable piece of content which will take you back to Contentful web app where you can make changes. It also adds ‚ÄúDraft‚Äù and ‚ÄúPending Changes‚Äù status indicators to all content if relevant.

## Deploy to Heroku
You can also deploy this app to Heroku:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)


## Use Docker
You can also run this app as a Docker container:

Step 1: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/contentful/the-example-app.nodejs.git
```

Step 2: Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t the-example-app.nodejs .
```





## üö® This project is now archived

[**This project is now archived and is no longer maintained.**](https://github.com/iaincollins/nextjs-starter/issues/122)

I'm happy so many people found this project useful, but it's now out of date and many of the features of this starter project are now redundant as Next.js has evolved considerably over the last few years and now has native support for features such as CSS and SASS and for API routes without requiring a custom server.

For that reason I'm retiring this project and putting it into archive mode.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to this project over the last 3 years!

#### Where to look for examples

* You can find up to date examples of how to use Next.js at https://github.com/vercel/next.js

* For an example of how to add authentication to Next.js project, check out NextAuth.js at https://next-auth.js.org

  There is a NextAuth.js example project with live demo at http://next-auth-example.now.sh

# Next.js Starter Project

This is a starter project for React that uses Next.js.

* Authentication via Email, Facebook, Twitter and Google+
* Uses Express combined with Passport JS for authentication and route handling
* Account management - Update details, link/unlink accounts, delete account
* Session support with secure HTTP Only cookies and CSRF Tokens
* SASS/SCSS wth Bootstrap 4 and Reactstrap with Bootstrap components for React
* Comes with Ionicons icon font and shows how to bundle other CSS and font files

You can see a live demo at **https://nextjs-starter.now.sh**

## About 

Next.js is a framework that makes it easy to create 'universal' React apps - React apps that do both client and server side rendering.

With Next.js, React pages are automatically rendered on both client and server side, without the hassle of setting up dependancies like webpack or babel and with automatic routing and without the constraints of projects like Create React App.

This is a starter project that provides an example of how to use Next.js with Express, SASS/SCSS, Bootstrap, Reactstrap (Boostrap 4 for React), the Ionicons icon set, examples of how to include data from remote REST APIs and incorporate an authentication system that supports both oAuth and Email using Passport (a popular authentication framework for Node.js).

This project exists to make it easier to get started a creating production app in React. You are invited to use it as a reference or to copy it and use it as a base for your own projects. Contributions to improve this project are welcome.

## Running locally in development mode

To get started, just clone the repository and run `npm install && npm run dev`:

    git clone https://github.com/iaincollins/nextjs-starter.git
    npm install
    npm run dev

Note: If you are running on Windows run install --noptional flag (i.e. `npm install --no-optional`) which will skip installing fsevents.

## Building and deploying in production

If you wanted to run this site in production, you should install modules then build the site with `npm run build` and run it with `npm start`:

    npm install
    npm run build
    npm start

You should run `npm run build` again any time you make changes to the site.

Note: If you are already running a webserver on port 80 (e.g. Macs usually have the Apache webserver running on port 80) you can still start the example in production mode by passing a different port as an Environment Variable when starting (e.g. `PORT=3000 npm start`).

## Configuring

If you configure a .env file (just copy [.env.example](https://github.com/iaincollins/nextjs-starter/blob/master/.env.example) over to '.env' and fill in the options) you can configure a range of options.

See the [AUTHENTICATION.md](https://github.com/iaincollins/nextjs-starter/blob/master/AUTHENTICATION.md) for how to set up oAuth if you want to do that. It suggested you start with Twitter as it's the easiest to get working.

## Deploying to the cloud with now.sh

To deploy to production on [Zeit's now.sh cloud platform](https://zeit.co) you will need to install the `Now` desktop app on your computer. If you don't want to install the `Now` desktop app, you can use the following command to install it (either approach is fine):

    sudo npm i -g --unsafe-perm now

Once installed, open `now.json` and set a `name` and `alias` for your site.

To deploy, just run `now` in the working directory:

    npm install -g now
    now

If you configure a .env file `now` will include it when deploying if you use the -E option to deploy:

    now -E

If you want to have your local `.env` file have variables for local development and have a different sent of variables you use in production, you can create additional .env files and tell `now` to use a specific file when deploying:

    now -E production.env


### After deploying

Once you have deployed, `now` will return a URL where the site when it has been deployed to, you can use this to preview everything works correctly in the browser.

If you have set an alias for the site, you can then make the site live on the alias you have defined using `now alias`:

    now alias
    
By default, this will point any aliases you have set in `now.json` to your site.

You can configure `now` to use aliases with custom domains using the `now domain` and `now dns` commands.

## Further reading

### Database hosting

If you need an instance of MongoDB in the cloud https://mlab.com/ have free and inexpensive options.

### Secrets for Environment Variables

Once you are comfortable using `.env` files for configuration and running and deploying your app, take a look at `now secrets` to set options in the cloud so you don't have to set them each time you deploy.

### GitHub integration

You can integrate `now` with a GitHub account to trigger automated deployments anytime you push to GitHub. This works great if you have secrets set up!

### Now 2.0

When you deploy this project you will see this message as of November 2018:

    WARN! You are using an old version of the Now Platform. More: https://zeit.co/docs/v1-upgrade

Now 2.0 was released in November 2018 and works differently from Now 1.0. This project has not been updated for Now 2.0. You may ignore this message for now.

### Alternate hosting options

You can host your Next.js site with any hosting provider. Although it works great on Now, it also works great with other providers like Heroku, Amazon Web Service, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, DigitalOcean and others.


Step 3: Run the Docker container locally:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d the-example-app.nodejs
```

If you created your own Contentful space, you can use it by overriding the following environment variables:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=<SPACE_ID> \
  -e CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN=<DELIVERY_ACCESS_TOKEN> \
  -e CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_TOKEN=<PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN> \
  -d the-example-app.nodejs
```
